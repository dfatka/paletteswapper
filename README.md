# Python-based palette swapper
Got a pixel art image with a small amount of colours and want to change whole palette at once? Well, hello.

This small GUI tool allows you to do just that, changing one color at time, picking new RGB (or possibly RGBA) values for each original colour.

## Dependencies
For the core of the palette swapper (paletteswapper_back.py) that does the actual work, you will need Python 3 with numpy and Pillow. If you also have numba, it will attempt to use it to speed up the colour changing, but it's not needed.
For the GUI layer that allows you to interact nicely with the clickable tool, you will also need PySimpleGUI.

## How to use
Intuitively. In progress.

## Screenshots
